# Django Signals Questions

This repository answers three key questions about the behavior of Django signals, with code examples to illustrate each concept.

## Description

Django signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when specific actions have taken place. In this project, we investigate:

1. Are Django signals synchronous or asynchronous by default?
2. Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
3. Do Django signals execute within the same database transaction as the caller?

## Questions and Solutions

### 1. Are Django signals synchronous or asynchronous by default?

Django signals are synchronous by default, meaning they are executed in the same flow as the caller.

**Code Example**:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received for {instance.name}")





2. Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. You can verify this by comparing the thread IDs of the caller and the signal handler.

Code Example:
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Handler in thread: {threading.get_ident()}")

obj = MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")
print(f"Main thread: {threading.get_ident()}")





3. Do Django signals execute within the same database transaction as the caller?
Yes, Django signals execute within the same database transaction, so if the transaction fails, the signal will be rolled back as well.

Code Example:
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import transaction

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.name = "Updated"
    instance.save()

# Create an object and update it in a transaction
obj = MyModel.objects.create(name="Initial")
print(f"Before transaction: {obj.name}")

with transaction.atomic():
    obj.name = "In Transaction"
    obj.save()
    print(f"In transaction: {obj.name}")
